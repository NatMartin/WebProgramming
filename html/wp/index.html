	  <h1>Modern Web programming</h1>
	  <p>
	    The golden age of code, where the programmer stood alone
	    to craft goundbreaking software, is over. Now, code is so
	    complicated that it requires teams of programmers to
	    develop, which, in turn, require new techniques to make
	    sure that the teams do not collape under the weight of
	    communications. This course is intended to teach web
	    programming so that students develop habit that will help
	    them out as they become programmers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This course prepares students to develop software in this
	    new world. It focuses on agile development techniques that
	    are in common use in industry. It covers:

	  <h2>Structure of the Course</h2>
	  <p>
	    The course comprises lessons and labs, which run
	    concurrently. In addition, there is a sequence of four
	    units.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the first unit, the lessons cover the development of
	    the computer from a User Interface perspective while the
	    labs lead the student to set up an environment in which
	    they can develop web sites.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The second unit's lessons and labs are more in sync. Both
	    cover programming: JavaScript, Testing, Databases, and
	    Architecture. The lecture provide overviews of the subject
	    and the labs give the students a chance to try them
	    out. This unit, as do many of the others, covers a lot of
	    material, so it touches on the subjects and provides links
	    to further information.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The lessons in the third unit focus on proces
	    covering: code quality, agile development, test driven
	    development, specification by example and lean
	    development. The labs in this section give students the
	    opportunity to practice what they hav elearned in the
	    second section. They are run as simplified Scrums where
	    each student has a story to implement and a set of
	    automated tests to satisfy.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The lessons in the fourth unit cover requirements
	    elicitation and management. The labs use a full
	    fledged Scrum development process. Groups work on a
	    project with daily standups and weekly demos.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Web Programming</h2>
	  <p>
	    Web programming is difficult. Many student have difficulty
	    learning a single programming language, but to program for
	    the web, they need to master at least three languages:
	    HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three languages are
	    necessary because they are the languages browsers
	    understand, and web programming cannot control the
	    browsers on which their programs run without these
	    languages.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    What's more, web programming requires the interation of a
	    least one client and server, the browser and web
	    server. Distributed programming increases the complexity
	    of writing code.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Web Stack: Linux, NodeJS, Mongo</h3>
	  <p>
	    The goal of this tutorial is to set up a system on which
	    you can develop web programs on your personal
	    computer. There are many ways to do this. The most common
	    is LAMP (or WAMP or MAMP) which stands for Linux, Apache,
	    MySQL and PHP (or Window or Mac). Another popular approach
	    is <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"> Ruby on
	    Rails </a>. For Java afficianatos there
	    is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages">
	    JavaServer Pages</a>. For those who prefer Python, there
	    is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">
	    Django </a>. All of these applications use a language
	    (PHP, or Ruby, or Java, or Python) to write HTML pages on
	    the server and write them to the client. This is not a bad
	    approach, but it sort of assumes that you already know how
	    to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to write a
	    lesson that teaches Web Programming from the beginning. So
	    I have chosen a Linux, NodeJS, MongoDB stack.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Linux, NodeJS and MongoDB make the process of learning the
	    basics a little easier because NodeJS runs JavaScript on
	    the server side. JavaScript is not a great langauage. It
	    is a loosely-typed, object-oriented language, which seems
	    almost a contradiction. However, it is what we have on the
	    client, so by using it to program the server as well, it
	    reduces the amount of syntax required. Furthermore,
	    MongoDB is a "document oriented database" which means that
	    it stores and returns objects that look like JavaScript
	    Objects again reducing the amount of syntax students need
	    to learn to experience web programming.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    By restricting the language to HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
	    we hope to make the process of learning how to manage
	    interacting clients and servers easier. Students use the
	    same language to program on the client that they do on the
	    server. The risk is that this can be confusing. With PHP
	    or Java or Ruby, it is clear when one is programming on
	    the server because the language is different. However, one
	    runs the risk of learning that the language is the
	    difference rather than the locus of program control. The
	    location of control significantly affects the decisions
	    one makes about programs. For example, one manages
	    security on the web server rather than the client because
	    the client is not under the programmers control in a
	    production environment. We hope that the single languages
	    makes these distinctions clear.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Learning the syntax of all of the languages involved is
	    challenging, but just learning the language is not enough
	    to become a competent programmer. In addition to the
	    syntax, a good programming must know how to develop
	    programs that are maintainable. Maintainable programs must
	    be easy to read and must have automated test
	    cases. Learning to write programs that are easy to read is
	    impossible unless people read and misunderstand them. In a
	    classroom, a teacher can read and comment on students
	    progmans, but such interactions, particularly in crowded
	    classrooms lacks thoroughness and immediacy. A better
	    approach is to have students read each others programs so
	    the learn first hand what is easy to read and what is
	    not. Writing programs easy to understand programs requires
	    multiple drafts. As with any language, the first draft of
	    a program usually stinks. Unfortunately, unlike natural
	    languages, typoes in programming languages can cause fatal
	    flaws rather than annoyance in the reader. Writing
	    multiple drafts requires automated testing, so modern
	    software development enphasizes automated testing. NodeJS
	    provides several ways of testing: end to end testing
	    with <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor">
	    Protractor </a> and unit testing
	    with <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html">
	    Karma</a>. Both of these rely
	    on <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>, which,
	    as an added benefit, uses JavaScript syntax.
