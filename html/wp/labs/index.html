	    Labs are where you will learn the practical aspects of
	    writing web programs. Theory gives you a models of the
	    world: it helps you predict what will happen when you
	    act. Practice teaches the range of things than can
	    happen. Without theory, we see only confusion
	    confusion. Without practice, we are blind.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Like the lessons, the labs break into four units
	    corresponding to the lesson units. The do not cover the
	    same material, however. In the first unit, while the
	    lessons cover the developing of computing and the
	    World Wide Web, the labs guide you through the development
	    of a working system that will let you build Web pages. It
	    shows you how to set up your operating system and an
	    editor. It introduces version control so you will never
	    lose your work. You build a Web server and then write
	    pages for that server using HTML and CSS. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The second unit follows the lessons more closely. It
	    introduces programming in JavaScript: the language the web
	    server was written in. It then introduces testing
	    frameworks because this class focuses on the process of
	    programming, not just the mechanics. It then introduces
	    more elements on the server side.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The third and fourth units allow you to consolidate the
	    information you have learned in the first two. These
	    follow a Scrum process whereby you are given a week to
	    work on a project uninterrupted, then, when the week is
	    over, you demonstrate what you have done.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The fourth unit continues with Scrum, but this time, you
	    will be working as a team. The goal of this unit is to
	    complete a real Web project in a realistic team setting.
