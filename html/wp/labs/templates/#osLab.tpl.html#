  <h1>Installing Linux</h1>
  <p>
    In this class, we will be using Unix-like operating
    systems because:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Probably most servers are hosted on Unix-like operating systems,
	it is hard to say for sure.
      </li>
      <li>
	Windows version of server programming hides a lot of the details
	of how the server works; it is easier to understand how the
	client and server work together on Unix-like systems.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2> Getting Ready </h2>
  <p>
    On the Mac, OS X is Unix, so you need to install Linux only if you
    are currently running Windows. Once installed, the computer will
    ask you which operating system you want to use when you log in. If
    you choose Linux, you will get a Linux GUI. You can then start a
    terminal window from the GUI. The following tutorial will guide
    you through downloading and installing Ubuntu Linux on your
    computer. There are many different versions of Linux; currently
    Ubuntu is the easiest to install and use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before installing Linux, you will need to:
    <ol>
      <li> Back up the data on your computer </li>
      <li> Create a disk from which you can restore Windows </li>
      <li> Create a disk or a pen drive from which you can boot Unix </li>
    </ol>
    These tasks will require some materials. You will need:
    <ol>
      <li>
	Some place to back up all of your data. Given the size of
	modern computer disks, unless the computer is new and the disk
	is empty, the only practical place to back up your computer is
	to another hard disk. You can back up your computer either to
	an external hard drive or to the cloud. In either case, This
	is a good investment: the time it will take to replace
	everything on your computer is much more valuable than the
	money required for a hard drive.
      </li>
      <li>
	A CD or DVD onto which you can burn a recovery disk.
      </li>
      <li>
	A CD, DVD, or Pen Drive than you can use to create a bootable
	copy of Linux.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Overview of Process</h2>
  <p>
    The process of installing Ubuntu is relatively easy. First,
    however, lets review the steps.
    <ol>
      <li> 
	Create a recovery disk for Windows if you have not already
	done so.
      </li>
      <li> 
	Backup your computer 
      </li>
      <li>
	Start installation of Ubuntu Linux
      </li>
      <li>
	Manually partition your disk drive to give Linux disk space.
      </li>
      <li>
	Finish installation of Ubuntu Linux
      </li>
      <li>
	Test the system to make sure you can boot into both Windows
	and into Ubuntu Linux
      </li>
      <li>
	
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, there are differences in the things you need to do
    depending on the version of Windows you are running. In
    particular, as of Windows 8, Microsoft moved from BIOS to UEFI
    complicating the process of installing Ubuntu. When OS differences
    occur, notes and pointers will be provided.
  </p>
  <h3>Create a Recovery Disk</h3>
  <p>
    You should create a recovery disk when you first get your
    computer. You never know when the disk drive will fail and you
    will need to reinstall your operating system. If you have a
    recovery disk, you are done with this step.
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, you are, like me, lazy and overly optimistic. Or you
    have lost your recovery disk. You should make one before starting
    the process. To do so:
    <ol>
      <li>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>Back up your Computer</h3>
  <p>
    Even more important than a recovery disk is a back up plan. Disk
    drives fail and when they do years of your work can dissappear in
    an instant. Back up your computer frequently. It is best if you
    have an automatic way to back it up. If you have a backup plan set
    up, click "Backup Now" and you are done.
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, lazyness and optimism have left you without a back up
    plan, now is your opportunity to set on up.
  </p>
  <h3>Install Linux</h3>
  <p>
    Now that your computer is safe, you can install Linux.
  </p>
  <ol class="activity">
    <li class="do">
      Put the Ubuntu CD/DVD in the CD or DVD drive. Reboot the computer.
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Select Try Ubuntu.
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Log on the the network.
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Right click on Install Ubunto 14.04.1 LTS and select "Open".
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Select your language.
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Check the boxes on "Download updates while installing" and
      "Install this third-party software", then click the "Continue"
      button.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Partition the Disk Drive</h3>
  <p>
    Linux will require space on the disk drive to run. It will need
    space to store files and swap space.
  </p>
  <ol class="activity">
    <li class="do">
      Select "Install Ubuntu alongside FreeDOS." Click "continue."
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Select "Install Now."
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Select Continuew when you get the box "Write previous changes to
      disk and continue?"
    </li>
    <li class="See">
      The computer will repartition the computer for a long time.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Finish installing Ubuntu</h3>
  <ol class="activity">
    <li class="do">
      Choose your time zone and hit "Continue."
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Select your keyboard and hit "Continue."
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Enter your name, the name of the computer. Choose and Username
      and select a password. Hit "Continue."
    </li>
    <li class="see">
      The computer will start installing Ubuntu. This will take several
      minutes. Perhaps as much an an hour.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Check that both operating systems are available</h3>
  <ol class="activity">
    <li class="do">
      Reboot the computer and log onto Windows 7. This may appear as
      FreeDOS. It may ask you if you want to run Chkdsk. Allow it
      to. Windows (or FreeDOS) needs to find how how big it's
      partition is now that it was resized.
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      The system will reboot, choose Window 7 (or freeDOS) again.
    </li>
    <li class="see">
      Windows should start. You should be able to log in.
    </li>
    <li class="do">
      Restart again and select Ubuntu.
    </li>
    <li class="see">
      Ubuntu should start. You should be able to log
      in. Congratulations, you have a dual-boot computer with Windows
      and Ubuntu.
    </li>
  </ol>
