    W3 Schools is a web site run by a family from Norway which earns
    money by placing advertizements on the site. By having you run
    through their tutorial, rather than writing one of my own, I can
    make sure that the tutorial stays up to date. It is an element of
    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The language is standard and their
    tutorials are the most popular on the web. By using theirs, you
    learn from a resource that is likely to be available and updated
    when you need a refresher or when the language changes.
