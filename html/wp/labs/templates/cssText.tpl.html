  Cascading Style Sheets provide formatting for web pages. HTML
  describes the structure of the document so the web browser can
  display it, but it relies on the web browser to make reasonable
  choices. Since the HTML can represent anything, it needs to be
  display in a very generic fashion. CSS lets the programmer instruct
  the web browser about how the text should work.

    W3 Schools.

  W3 Schools is a web site run by a family from Norway which earns
  money by placing advertizements on the site. By having you run
  through their tutorial, rather than writing one of my own, I can
  make sure that the tutorial stays up to date. It is an element of
  DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The language is standard and their
  tutorials are the most popular on the web. By using theirs, you
  learn from a resource that is likely to be available and updated
  when you need a refresher or when the language changes.
