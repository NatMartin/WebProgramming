  <h2> Getting Ready </h2>
  <p>
    In this class, we will be using Unix-like operating
    systems because:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Probably most servers are hosted on Unix-like operating systems,
	it is hard to say for sure.
      </li>
      <li>
	Windows version of server programming hides a lot of the details
	of how the server works; it is easier to understand how the
	client and server work together on Unix-like systems.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have a Macintosh, you are in luck, OS X is a Unix-like
    system. You will have to learn to user the terminal program, but you
    do not need to install a new OS. If you have a Windows system, you
    will need to install Linux. Fortunately, this is not particularly
    hard, and it only needs to be done once.
  </p>

  <h3> On the Macintosh </h3>
  <p>
    Getting ready to user a Unix-like system on the Mac is
    easy. All you need to do is find the Terminal program and
    pin it to your command bar.

  <h3> On the PC </h3>
  <p>
    On the PC, things are more difficult. First, you are going to have
    to install Linux on your computer. After that, the computer will ask
    you which operating system you want to use when you log in. If you
    choose Linux, you will get a Linux GUI. You can then start a
    terminal window from the GUI. The following tutorial will guide you
    through downloading and installing Ubuntu Linux on your
    computer. There are many different versions of Linux; currently
    Ubuntu is the easiest to install and use.
  </p>
  <h4> Install Linux </h4>
  <p>
    Linux comprises many distributions. A distribution is a copy of the
    core of the operating system--the Linux Kernel--and the programs
    that run on top of it--almost always the GNU stack. In Linux, and
    almost all modern operating system, consist of a small core program
    that does the work that needs to be done without interference from
    other program such a switching from one program to another when
    multitasking. On top of the kernal, other programs do most of the
    work that we interact with. For example, the file system is a
    program that runs on top of the kernal. Distributions provide ways
    to install the operating system and support for it such as user
    groups. They usually fund themselves through consulting about the
    operating system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, as of 2014, Ubuntu is probably the easiest to
    install. That being said, it is not particularly easy because there
    are a many different software systems that have different
    requirements. If you have a older windows operating system (pre
    Windows 8) you are in luck; it is relatively easy to install. I
    bought a Windows 8.1 Dell computer to run through this tutorial, and
    it is difficult to install Linux. (But, for me, well worth it,
    because I find Windows 8 one of my most frustrating experiences in
    life.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Ubuntu has information about how to install on recent PC at the page
    on <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI">UEFI</a>. This
    is probably the most reliable place to find information about how to
    install ubunto on your computer. It is maintained my the Ubuntu
    community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Step by step instructions for Windows 8 are available here. I
    recommend going through them, because it is tricky. In fact, I
    recommend going through these web sites rather than the instructions
    here because, the give you better pictures.

<h4>Get Ubuntu Linux</h4>

<ol class="activity">
  <li> Go to <a href="www.ubuntu.com">www.ubuntu.com</a>.  </li>
  <li> Click on "Download Ubuntu." </li>
  <li> Click on "Ubuntu Desktop"  </li>
  <li> Choose the flavor from the drop down. You can find out what
    type of computer you have by going to the Control Panel &gt System
    and Security &gt System, or click on My PC (or this PC) and select
    properties. It will tell you if you have a 64 bit computer. In
    general it will be:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>64-bit if you have a relatively new computer.  </li>
    <li>32-bit computer if you have an old one.  </li>
    <li>
      64-bit Mac (AMD64) if you have a new Apple Computer, but if you
      have a new Apple Computer running OS X you already have unix
      running, so you don't need it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click on Download</li>
</ol>

<h4>Back up your computer </h4> 
<p>
  To back up your computer you will need at least an 8 GB pen drive
  and probably a 16 GB pen drive. You can also back up to an external
  hard drive.
</p>

<h5>On Windows 8.1</h5>

<ol class="activity">
  <li> 
    On the Charms Bar select search. (You get to the Charms Bar by
    moving the mouse to the upper left or right hand window corner or
    clicking Windows-C.
  </li>
  <li>Search for File History</li>
  <li> a Window will open shoing File History</li>
  <li>
    Turn on File History by clicking the Turn On button on the lower
    right hand side.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is probably a good idea to back up your operating system too.
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="wp-text-area">
  <h5> Create a bootable memory stick </h5>
  <p>
    Before you start, make sure that there is nothing you need on the
    pen drive you are going to use. Everything on the pen drive will
    be erased.
  </p>
</div>

<ol class="activity">
  <li>Go to
    <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">
      www.pendrivelinux.com
    </a> and download the UUI.
  </li>
  <li>When the .exe file loads, run it. </li>
  <li>Click I agree on the license agreement</li>
  <li>Choose Ubuntu as your operating system.</li>
  <li>Choose the file that contain the Ubuntu Operating System</li>
  <li>Select your USB drive and click Create</li>

<h5> Partition your Hard Drive to give Linux space </h5>

<ol class="activity">
  <li>
    Find the Charms Bar and Search for Partitions. Choose Create and
    format partitions when it appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the Disk Management screen appears, right click on the OS
    (C:) line and select Shrink volume
  </li>
  <li>
    It will scan the disk and give you a box that will tell you the
    amount of space on the disk, the amount by which you can shrink it
    and the size after the shrink. Choose a number less than or equal
    to the space to shrink in MB. I chose to shrink by the maximum
    amount.
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot of unallocation space will appear. Ubuntu will be installed
    there.
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="wp-text-area">
  <h5>Turn off Fast Boot </h5>
  <p>
    Never mind. This doesn't seem to do any good.
  </p>
</div>

<ol class="activity">
  <li> Go to the Charm Bar and type Control Panel </li>
  <li> Choose Power Options </li>
  <li> Select "Choose what the power button does" </li>

  <h5> Install the Operating System </h5>
  <p>
    You will need to know how much memory you have in your computer.
  </p>
</div>
<ol class="activity">
  <li> Choose a swap area of 50000 MB for the operating system, A
    Logical partition whose location is "Beginning or this space",
    Used as "Ext4 journaling file system", Mount point "/".
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a swap area of whatever is left minux twice the size of
    your memory for the operating system, A Logical partition whose
    location is "Beginning or this space", Used as "Ext4 journaling
    file system", Mount point "/home".
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a swap aread of twice your memory area for swap space, A
    Logical partition whose location is "Beginning or this space",
    Used as "swap space", mount point will be grayed out.
  </li>
  <li> press "Install Now"</li>
  <li>Choose your time zone and keyboard layout.</li>
  <li>
    Enter your name, a name for your computer, a user name, and a
    password. (You will probably also want to require login.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Ubuntu should load. With luck, you will be able to log into it
    when you restart.
  </li>
</ol>
