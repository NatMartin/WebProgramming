  <h1>Coordinating through Git</h1>
  <p>
    Git, the program you have been using for source control, helps
    coordinate team work. When working in team, multiple people work
    on the same code base at the same time. As people work on the code
    base, they can introduce subtle bugs unless great care is taken to
    test each new addition in the context of all previous additions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, suppose Ashish changes a function that Betty's
    function relies on. He tests the changes to make sure that Betty's
    function still works before he checks it back in. In the mean
    time, Betty also changes her function, she tests it against the
    function that Ashish is in the process of changes to make sure it
    still works before she checks it in. However, when they both check
    in their work, the changes that Ashish has made break Betty's new
    code. Now, the code no longer works, and it may be months before
    the error is discovered. With luck, it will be discovered at the
    demo, without luck, it will be discovered after both Ashish and
    Betty have left the team and no one remembers what the code was
    supposed to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Git provides a repository in which everyone stores their
    code. Before it allows anyone to check new code in, it checks the
    code that is being check in against the code in the repository and
    to make sure that everything being checked in is compatible with
    the latest version. If it is not, it will not allow the code to be
    check in until it is compatible. Even if the team's code has
    change in a different file, it will not allow you to check it
    in. It will force you to check out the new code from the team's
    version before you can check in your new code. You, of course,
    should test your code against the team's version before checking
    in your changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, If Ashish made his changes first, when Betty tried to
    check in her code, she would have to check out his changes. She
    would then test here changes against the new code, find and change
    the incompatibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The teams code should always work. If it does not, bad code will
    be built on top of bad code. Eventually the code becomes so
    corrupted that fixing any one of the bugs is likely to create
    problems in other parts of the code. Unfortunately, that is the
    state of may industrial code bases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, a principle of agile development is that the code base
    always works. It may not do everything desired of it, but what it
    does do, it does correctly. Test Driven Development helps insure
    correctness at the unit level; team source control helps insure
    correctness in end-to-end operation.
