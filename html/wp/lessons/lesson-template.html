	    Programming requires two very different kinds of
	    knowledge: concrete practical knowledge about how to
	    accomplish specific tasks and theoretical knowledge about
	    what the tasks accomplish. It is like learning to ride a
	    bicycle: you need to know how to balance and pedal, but
	    you also need to know to ride on the side of the
	    road. Practical knowledge you can only learn by doing; it
	    gives you the meanings of the words. Theoretical knowledge
	    you can only learn by reading and talking; it gives you
	    the ways the words fit together.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This section of the web site gives you the theoretical
	    knowledge. It is broken into four sections. The first
	    section covers the development of computing and the World
	    Wide Web. This will describe how digital computers have
	    developed since their first appearance. This part of the
	    class will show you how user interfaces have changes under
	    the influence of the hardware available and the demands
	    placed on that hardware.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The second section covers the programming of the World
	    Wide Web. This is the theoretical aspects of the practical
	    work you will have been doing in the labs. It will cover
	    the particular choices made by the labs and the
	    alternatives to these choices.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The third section covers techniques for programming. It
	    teaches how to develop programs that can survive in the
	    real world, that is, programs that the programming can be
	    confident that they do what is intended and can change
	    when they need to.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The fourth section covers techniques for making sure that
	    when they program do what is intended, they are also doing
	    things that their users want them to. That is, the third
	    section teaches how to write programs that do what they
	    are supposed to do; the fours section teaches how to write
	    programs that do what people want them to do. These are
	    very different things: A program that only adds 2+2 works
	    correctly when it produces the answer 4, but it is
	    unlikely to be used by anyone. This section will show how
	    to find out what people want to do.
