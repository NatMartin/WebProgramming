      <h1>Operating Systems</h1>
      <h2> Three types of Operating System </h2>
      <p>
	There are three common operating systems currently in use
	(2014): Windows, the operation system developed by Microsoft,
	OS X, the operating system developed by Apple, and Linux: a
	Unix-like operating system that was developed by Linus
	Torvalds and is maintained by an open-source consortium. Of
	these three types of operating systems, there are two broad
	catagories: OS X and Linux, which are based on Unix; and
	Windows, which is based on DOS.
      </p>
      <h3> Unix </h3>
      <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix'>
	History of Unix
      </a>
      <p>
	Unix was developed at Bell Labs as a replacement for a more
	complicated system called Multics, which was intended to
	provide computing as a service in the same way that
	electricity is provided ad a service. Multics proved to be too
	complicated, and Bell Labs pulled out and some of the
	researchers started their own project, which they called Unics
	as a pun on Multics (it was a Uniplexed Information and
	Computing System rather than a Multiplexed Information and
	Computing systems). Bell Labs was owned by AT&amp T, which
	required to give away any technology that was not related to
	telephones by a 1956 anti-trust consent decress. They sent
	copies of the operating system to anyone who asked.
      </p>
      <p>
	Unix was also the first operating system to be written in a
	high level language, C, which was invented for the purpose,
	making it much easier for students in universities to modify
	it. It spread widely through Universities because it was a
	powerful, free operating system through this spread influnced
	many of the operating systems that followed, including DOS.
      </p>
      <p>
	In 1983, AT&amp T was broken up as part of another anti-trust
	law suit and the 1956 consent decress was anulled. AT&amp T
	started selling Unix systems, leading Richard Stallman to form
	a project called GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) to reimpliment Unix from
	the ground up without any code from AT&amp T. AT&amp T sold
	the rights to Unix, leading to almost three decades of law
	suits over who owned the code, which, for the most part, were
	resolved in 2010 leaving Unix free from copyright challenges.

	The GNU project continued working on a version of Unix that
	was free form the copyright wards thoughout the 80's and, by
	1992 had completed everything except the kernel--the small
	portion of the operating system the allows the rest of the
	system to run. Linux Torvalds, a sudent at the University of
	Helsinki, independently write a version of the operating
	system he call Linux. This was combined with the software from
	the GNU project to form GNU/Linux, or as most people say
	"Linux." Linux is now hosted on more different types of
	computers than any other operating system.
      </p>
      <h3>OS X</h3>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">OS X </a>
      <p>
	In 1999, Apple release the version version of OS X, a new
	operating system for its Macintosh computers. OS X is a
	standard version of Unix, running a Apple proprietary
	Graphical User Interface (GUI).
      </p>

      <h3> Windows </h3>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>
      <p>
	Windows has a very different history. Windows started as a
	graphical user interface to MS-DOS, an operating system
	developed by Microsoft for the IBM-PC, which was introduced in
	1981.  DOS was developed in only six week as a clone of an
	operating system called CP/M for the new Intex 8086
	processor. It was bought by Microsoft and licensed to IBM for
	the new IBM-PC, which ran on the 8086 processor. DOS rode the
	IBM-PC's rapid rise to become common. DOS has a command-line
	interface, which was made obsolete by the introduction of
	Graphical User Interfaces on the Xerox Start in 1981, the
	Apple Lisa in 1983, and most importantly, the Apple Macintosh
	in 1985.
      </p>
      <p>
	Initally, Windows was a program that ran on DOS to give the PC a
	GUI. Windows took over more of the operating system's operatings
	until the release of Windows NT in 1993.
