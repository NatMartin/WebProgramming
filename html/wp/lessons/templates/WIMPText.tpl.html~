  <h1>The Personal Computer</h1>
  <p>
    Hardware development make the next change in Human Computer
    Interaction possible, but the changes to the HCI were the result
    of changes to the software the new hardware supported. Computers
    prices fell to the point where individuals could afford them
    dedicating the full power to the computer to that individual. This
    low cost computing first provided the same application that the
    costly comuters had, using the added computation power to making
    the tasks easier accomplish. However, the low cost also opened
    computing to many more people, so programmers searched for new
    tasks that non-engineers might use. These new tasks needed to be
    offered in ways that non-engineers could use. This lead to a
    dramatic change in computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, changes since the development of the minicomputer have
    been driven by ever cheaper hardware. As hardware becomes cheaper,
    the cost of computing shifts from the machine to the users who run
    the machines: it becomes more expensive to pay the people who
    write and use the software than it does to buy the machines. Also,
    as hardware costs decrease, its user base increases makeing it
    worth while to build ever more expensive software. The per person
    cost of a million dollar software project is much less for a
    million people than it is for ten.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changes in computing are driven by changes in hardware cost, but
    these changes still surprise. It was hard to image in the days of
    terminals attached to minicomputers that people would trip while
    surfing the web on their smart phones.
    <h2>Mini to Micro Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The microcomputer represents the first step on the way to the
    present. Where the minicomputer relied on Large Scale Integration
    (LSI), which allow the productions of banks of computer components
    on single silicon chips, the minicomputer relies on Very Large
    Scale Integration (VLSI), which allows the production of full CPUs
    on a single chip. VLSI CPU production is based on a printing
    process, reducing thier cost. The cost became so low that in the
    early 1980's giving people their own computer began to make sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time sharing did not disappear when each person got their own
    computer because now the computers worked on multiple tasks at the
    same time. People do not like waiting for their own work to
    complete before starting their next task than they do waiting for
    someone elses task to complete. By allowing more than one
    programming on a dedicated computer, a person could compile a
    program while editing another. Still, the interface was similar to
    the interface one had through a terminal to a minicomputer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The low cost of hardware and the possibility of computers targeted
    to individuals unleased experimentation with alternative types of
    interfaces. The tasks of editing, compiling and running programs
    left lots of computing power left over for other tasks. This left
    over computing power was focused on improving the ease of using
    the computer. Displays became pixel addressable so they could
    display graphics instead of simply displaying text. Pixel
    addressable displays require more computation to control (for
    example, instead of putting an ASCII character into the display's
    memory, the computer needed to compute the pixels that comprise
    the character and put that in the display's memory). But on the
    new personal computers, there was lots of computation to spare.
  </p>
  <h2>Window, Icons, Menus and Pointer</h2>
  <p>
    The power of the personal computer supports a new
    interface. Instead of a command line interface where the user
    types commands that correspond to program the computer will run,
    it provides a graphical representation of those commands. It shows
    multiple programs executing through muliple windows that can
    represent virtual terminals into the computer. It creates
    graphical environments over the top of the terminal to make allow
    the user to enter the commands and view the results in ways that
    correspond to common real world activities. It shows the possible
    action the user can select through icons and menus and provides a
    pointer through which the user selects the possible
    actions. Instead of a conversation between the machine and the
    human, the interface allow the human to interact with the computer
    like he or she is flying a plane or exploring a new world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Underneath the illusion being presented, the computer is still
    just doing arithmetic, reading and writing as did Turing's
    machine. It writes values that correspond to a point of colored
    light into the memory that the display shows. It reads the values
    being produced by the tiny wheels on the mouse and changes the
    display memory to correspond to changes to make it look like an
    arrow is tracking across the screen. It reads a different value
    when the mouse button is clicked and, depending on the location of
    the mouse, it executes the program corresponding with that
    location.
  </p>
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>
    The personal computer unleashed vast amounts of computation power
    that is used to present the illusion of simplicity, but the
    personal computer was in one sense, as step backwards from the
    shared computers that preceeded it. Shared computers made it
    possible for people to share data. It made working together
    easy. On the new personal computers it was not as easy. The
    internet and the World Wide Web overcame these limitations.
