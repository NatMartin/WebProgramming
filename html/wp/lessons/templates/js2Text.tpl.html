  <h1>JavaScript Peculiarities</h1>
  <p>
    JavaScripts birth as a scripting language has given JavaScript some
    peculiar attributes. Shell scripting languages let people automate
    simple operating system tasks such as setting up users and
    groups. These programs tend to be temporary and short, so they
    call for a language that gets the job done, but doesn't impose a
    lot of structure. Since the were temporary and short, there was no
    need to write them in such a way that others could extend and fix
    them. These languages tend to have loose typing and forgiving syntax.  
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript is designed in this way. Every element in JavaScript is
    an object and all variables are references to objects. This means
    that there is only one type of variable in JavaScript, which can
    refer to any type of object. Even more surprising, these objects
    can be changed at run time: members can be added, deleted or
    changed. What's more, functions are also objects, which can be
    assigned to variables and changed at run time. This freedom of
    expression allows for very obscure JavaScript programs, which if
    they are short and temporary is less of a problem. However,
    JavaScript, because it has become ubiquitous on the web, has
    become ubiquitous everywhere. As the dynamic and mobile webs
    devloped, people began writing ever more complicated JavaScript
    programms until they were no longer short and
    temporary. Writing in JavaScript requires great discipline.
  <h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript is different from other languages in the following
    ways.
    <ul>
      <li>
	Like many scripting languages, uses dynamic typing in which
	the type of a variable is determined by its content. That is,
	you can assign an integer to a variable then a couple of lines
	later, assign a string to it. The "feature" can lead to mean
	hard-to-find bugs.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is also completely object based: everything is an
	object. Both the string and the integer you assign to a
	variable are objects.
      </li>
      <li>
	Functions are first class objects in JavaScript. You can
	assign a function to a variable and call the function based on
	that variable. In fact, functions are also objects which
	methods such as .call() defined on them.
      </li>
      <li>
	Unlike most object-oriented languages, JavaScript is based on
	prototypes rather than classes. Objects are defined by other
	objects which server as a prototype rather than being defined
	by a class. In JavaScript you can create a new object either
	by defining it directly in the code or by defining it based on
	a different object using <code>Object.create()</code>. For
	example:
	<div class="code">
var foo = {one: 1, two: 2};
var bar = Object.create(foo);
bar.three = 3;
bar.three == bar.one + bar.two;
foo.three // is undefined
	</div>
	Here foo is an object defined directly in the code and bar is
	defined from foo. The bar object is them modified by adding a
	new attribute, <code>three</code>. The foo object does not
	have the new attribute.
      </li>
  </p>
  <p> 
    Each of these features makes JavaScript programs different from
    other languages.
  </p>
  <h3>Dynamic Typing</h3>
  <p>
    Most modern languages provides strong typing. That is, each
    variable must be designated as containing only a certain type of
    object: a variable may contain an integer or a character, but a
    variable that may contain an integer may not contain a character
    and vice versa. Typing is imposed by the compiler: both integers
    and characters are sequences of binary digits, so whether they are
    integers or characters depends only how the program uses them. 
  <h2>Writing in JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    The discipline required to write good JavaScript is no different
    from the discipline required to write any other language: the
    discipline is diligent attention to the thought processes of your
    reader. Your reader is not the computer, the computer only
    understands machine code, so it never sees the object code; your
    reader is the human being who has to fix the program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember,
    <ol>
      <li>
	Software only breaks when it is fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
	Only useless software isn't broken.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Software is a description of behavior, so it cannot break the way
    physical objects break: the behavior it describes remains the
    behavior it describes. Problems arise only when the behavior it
    describes is not the behavior people want. But people are fickle:
    they want one thing one day something else the next. What's more,
    they are better that they don't want what you have than they are
    at knowing they do want want you propose. It would be easier to
    write software if people were not involved in using it, but, if no
    one uses the software, it is useless.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, when you write software, your audience is the readers who will
    need to change the behavior of the program. They will be changing
    the code to fit the needs of people from the future. There are
    three such audiences:
    <ol>
      <li>
	Your future self: you will not remember the details of the
	code you write today.
      </li>
      <li>
	Your collegues: you will need help to get your code finished.
      </li>
      <li>
	Strangers: When you have moved on to something else, if you
	have written a good program, other people will need to update
	it.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your first audience will be yourself. If you write clear logical
    code, you will write faster because you will spend less time
    figuring out what each snippet of code does before moving on to
    the next snippet.  This is the easiest audience. If you pay
    attention, you can tell when awkward code is slowing your
    progess. If you find yourself going back a reading function to
    figure out what they do, you have written awkward code. The names
    of the pieces of your code should tell you everything you need to
    know about that piece of code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your second audience will be the other programmers you are working
    with. Fortunately, you can read their minds. If you talk to them,
    they will talk to you, displaying what is on their minds. If you
    find that they need to ask you what a piece of code does, you have
    written awkward code. Ask them what they do
    not understand and you can improve your code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your third audience is the most difficult. These are the
    programmers who come long after you have moved on to other
    projects, but who need to fix your code. That they need to fix
    your code is a tribute to its usefulness: it has lived long enough
    for people to realize that they would like it to do something a
    little different. However, these people cannot ask you questions
    and you cannot fix the code to help them understand it. To support
    these people, you will need to rely on your first two audiences,
    principles of programming that have been developed over the years,
    and conventions that all programmers follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    A well written piece of code is a pleasure to read. It tells you
    what you need to know before you know you need to know it. It
    feels as that the clarity of the code only deepens as you read
    it. Such code comes from the minds of truely gifted
    programmers, just as the best writing comes from the mind of
    gifted writers. Indeed in natural language is very like coding. As
    Mark Twain said, "The pain of reading is inversly propotional to
    the pair of writing."
  </p>
  <h2>Learn to write by reading</h2>
  <p>
    As with writing in a natural language, one learns to write code by
    reading other people's code. Through reading, you learn the basic
    principles of well structured code. As you work through the lab
    lesson, pay attention to the code. It is simple but it shows you
    what professional programmers expect from code. At the same time,
    try to think of how the code could be improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the function the the first example in the tutorial
    is:
  </p>
</div>
    <div class="code">
function changeImage() {
    var image = document.getElementById('myImage');
    if (image.src.match("bulbon")) {
        image.src = "pic_bulboff.gif";
    } else {
        image.src = "pic_bulbon.gif";
    }
}
    </div>
<div class="wp-text-area">
  <p>
    No one would think that this is bad code. It is indented properly
    and follows all of the conventions of good JavaScript code. The
    opening braces for the blocks are on the line where the block
    starts, and the closing brace matched to object associated with
    the block.
  </p>
  <h3>Use descriptive names</h3>
  <p>
    Still, the code could be improved, as can all code. When improving
    code, look first to the names you use. Names are the most
    important element of clean code. Does the name of the function say
    exacly what the function does? Do the names of the variable tell
    exactly what the variable is supposed to hold.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the name image, could be more accurate. It is
    not really an image, rather, it is a document element that
    displays an image of a light bulb. A better name would be
    "lightImg" which indicates that it is an img element and that it
    displays a light bulb.
  </p>
  <p>
    This change improves the code, but not very much. It states
    clearly what is held in the variable, but the code itself states
    clearly what is held in the variable. If we named the variable
    "x", a terrible name, it would not make the code much worse
    because a fluent JavaScript reader can see from the code what the
    variable really refers to.
  <p>
    An example, that improves the code more is renaming the function
    itself. The name of the function promices more than the function
    delivers: it does not change images, rather it changes a
    particular image on the page from one to another. A better name
    would be "lightSwitch", which inindicates that the function really
    switches the state of the bulb. This particular function name also
    relies calls up the image of a light switch. The intuitive name
    makes the name of the img tag more evocative too. 
  <p>
    In subsequent examples, the function is called myFunction, which
    is a terrible name. It is long, but tells nothing about what the
    function does.
  </p>
  <p>
    Naming functions is most important, because they may be used in
    places far from their definition. Here, the only thing indicating
    the purpose of the function is the name of the function. When
    creating a function name, think about how to express to someone
    who has never see your code what the function does. At the same
    time, try to keep the name as short as possible. This sets up a
    tension: you want the name to express clearly what the function
    does in as few characters as possible.
  </p>
  <h3>Limit functions to one task</h3>
  <p>
    Paying attention to names will improve your code more than any
    other single thing you can do, but functions need to be written so
    they have short descriptive names. Here, the function is of the
    right size. It fits on the page making it easy to understand what
    the function does. More importantely, however, it does only one
    thing. It turns on a light bulb, so it is easy to create a short
    descriptive name for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the name and the function are easy to generate
    and easy to name because they correspond to a particular physical
    actions. More often, functions refer to actions that are internal
    to the operation of the computer. In this case, making sure that
    the that the function does only one thing is easy because they can
    match intuitions about actions in the real world.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a more complicated example consider a function that accepts a
    new password: it accepts a new password and as the person repeats
    it, the function changes the border of the box to red if the
    characters fail to match.
