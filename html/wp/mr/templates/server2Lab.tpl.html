  <h2>Reading a file on the disk</h2>
  <p>
    The first test will be that the server can read the information from the disk and create an array from the information. But how do we do that? How do we read a JavaScript array from the disk in node.js? To answer these questions, we can use our test environment. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to look up the <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html">node.js file system reference</a>. From that we see that we can read a file using <code>readFile</code> and <code>readFileSync</code>; we can write files using <code>writeFile</code> and <code>writeFileSync</code>. The <code>Sync</code> versions of the calls are synchronous; they do not take a callback function. The parameters to <code>readFile(filename[, options], callback)</code> are a string holding the name of the file to be read, options, of which we need to supply <code>'utf8'</code> if we want a string back, and the callback function. The parameters to <code>readFileSync(filename[, options])</code> are the same except we need not supply a callback function; instead it returns the contents of the file as the return value. The parameters to <code>writeFile(filename, data[, options], callback)</code> and <code>writeFileSync(filename, data[, options])</code> are the same a <code>readFile</code> except for <code>data</code>. The <code>data</code> parameter is the location where the data will be stored. It should be either a string, if the option <code>'utf8'</code> was supplied, or a buffer, if no encoding option was supplied.
  </p>
  <h3>Trying it out</h3>
  <p>
    We can try this out first using our testing environment. After some experimentation, I got the following test to work. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The first thing I do is require the file system using <code>require("fs")</code>. Notice that I do that within the test so that I do not pollute any of the other tests. Next I create and array of entries. I then use <code>fs.writeFileSync("test.html", JSON.stringify(blogWritten))</code> to write out the file. I use the <code>Sync</code> version to make sure that the file is written before it is read. Otherwise, there is a possibility that the reader's callback would execute before the writer's callback. I also use <code>JSON.stringify</code> to turn the array into a string before I write it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having set up the test by writing known contents to a particular file, I then call <code>fs.readFile("test.html", 'utf8', callback)</code> to read the contents of the file I just wrote. If an error is return I throw it, but if not error is returned, I parse the string I read back into an array, and expect that the array I read is the equal to the array I wrote.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the test uses a parameter with one function, called <code>done</code>. This helps deal with the asynchronous read function. The test will not complete until the <code>done</code> function is called, so when I call <code>fs.readFile</code>, I can make it wait until the function returns. If I do not do this, the tests are likely to complete bevore the file is read and the <code>expect</code> test executes.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the test works, I know I can read and write to a file. I leave the test in my spec in case I need to remember how to do it later. These examples can also be helpful to someone who is new to your code. They show how difficult elements of the code the same way that comments can help. The advantage of doing them as working code is that they will run every time the tests are run, helping to ensure that they continue to be correct. Because comments are not executed, it is easy to forget to update them making them, worse than useless, misleading.

  fs.readFile("test.html", 'utf8', function(error, doc) {

  <h3>Writing the test</h3>
  <p>
    Now we are ready to write the test. We want to check that the blog post's can be read from the file. We create a fake request and result, and make sure that the blog post gets read.
  </p>
  <p>
    I set up the test by requireing the file system so I can write the test file. Then I set up fake results and requests and set the requestFake url to <code>"spec/test.html"</code>. I create an array with two entries and then write that array into the test file. I expect the <code>posts(resultFake)</code> to equal the array I wrote to the file. The function <code>posts(resultFake)</code> gets the string returned by resultFake and turns it back into an array. When this works, I know that the server is reading the data from <code>spec/test.html</code> correctly.

  <h3>Testing Asynchronous Behavior</h3>
  <p>
    The problem is not that the information is not being processed properly. In fact, what we are asking the system to do, returning a string representation of a file, should already be part of the behavior of the system. The only difference is that the string being returned this time is not part of a web page or a JavaScript program. So why does the program fail? 
  </p>

    The answer is asynchrony. Let's modify out program so that when it returns the page, it prints it to the console.

  <p>
    You can see <code>Server result is: none</code> and the test fails. However, after the test fails, we see the message <code>Static Server: html/spec/test.html["blog entry 1","blog entry 2"]</code>. The problem is that when we read the file, it kicks off an asynchronous process and continues working. The asynchronous process works while the current process proceeds, returning to the test and failing, because it has not yet read the information into the <code>resultFake</code>. We need to make the process synchronous in our test because we are not really running in a server that will continue to loop until the information returns.
  </p>
  <p>
    To do this, we replace the asynchronous call to <code>readFile</code> with the synchronous call to <code>readFileSync</code> in our test. The function <code>readFileSync</code> will not start a new process, instead it will wait until the information is read from the file and put in its proper place before continuing on to the expectation. This way, we can be sure that the values have been placed in the <code>resultFake</code> before we need to extract them.

    What we have done is swapped <code>readFileSync</code> for <code>readFile</code> for this test. That is, during this test, the functions that normally call readFile, now call readFileSync. To make this work, we need to call the callback function that is passed to <code>readFile</code> with the contents of the file that we get from <code>readFileSync</code>. This way, the function will read all of the information from the file and call the callback function before to goes on to do anything else. That is, it will block any further processing until the read is complete. In this way, we can be sure that the data will be in the <code>resultFake</code> before we check to see if it is there with the <code>expect</code>.

    Now we see that the test works. We can go on to upgrade the server. We know that the server can read information from a file.    
  </p>
</div>
  <h3>Altering the server code</h3>
  <p>
    Test driven development lets me update the server code without worrying that I will break something that worked previously. Every time I run my tests, it tests all of the code that I wrote before. This gives me confidence to make signifiant changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server sends back information requested by the browser. HTTP describes a "GET" operation that is expected to return a file. The browser interprets the file based on type metadata. This metadata tells it whether it should be text, HTML, JavaScript or something else. The data returns it returned based on the url in the request. Here, the url is going to be <code>test.html</code> so we will want to have it return a string representation of our blog array when it sees that url.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next thing we will want to do is make sure that the code we write actually put the values into an array. The first thing we do is write a test. The previous test does most of what we want, it reads an array from a file; now we want to put what it reads in a variable. We do not want to lose our previous test, however, so the first thing we do is copy the previous test.
  </p>
  <p>
   We will need to make two alterations to the test.
   <ol>
     <li>
       We will need to change the file it is writing to, because otherwise changes we make to the server will cause the previous test to fail. Web servers work by computing based on the URL that it receives, so, to get independent tests, we need independant URLs. The reason for this change will become clearer when we edit our <code>server.js</code> file.
     </li>
     <li>
       We will need to check the variable in which the array has been stored. This poses a problem. The array is a private variable in the server module. To get it, we will need to break into the module. Rewire allows us to do that. The function <code>__get__</code> takes a string that represents a variable in the module and returns its value. Using it we can look at the variable <code>blogPosts</code>. 
     </li>
   </ol> 
  </p>

    We run the file and find that we get two errors. Namely that the template is not available. We write the template and store it in the template directory. The template will appear as below. It is the code we want minus the array of blog posts at the top.

<div class="code">
var outArea = document.getElementById("blogOutput");
var inArea = document.getElementById("blogContent");

function addBlog() {
  posts.push(inArea.value);
  outArea.innerHTML = "";
  for (var i = posts.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    outArea.innerHTML = outArea.innerHTML + "&lthr&gt" + posts[i];
  };

    This way of producing web page to be returned is common. The web pages are often written as partial web pages, or templates, and combined with other elements that are computed. The process may become complicated with various pieces of the web page being constructed and interleaved with pieces that are written. Here the task is relatively simple so we can do by writing JavaScript code in the browser. More sophisticated web page constrution requires a framework. Common frameworks for developing web pages are Java Server Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP: Hypertest Preprocessor (PHP), etc.

    Here we the here, we simply add the value of the blog array to a variable at the top of the JavaScript. We run the test and it works.
