  <h2>Planning the Tasks</h2>
  <p>
    The story we are working on is "As a blog writer, I want to be able to save my posts so that I do not have to retype them." It sounds like it will be easy, but as developers we know that it will involve development on the server side. The first thing we want to do is figure out how will will accomplish the task.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will need to update our server program so that when the user navigates to the blog, a program runs. This program will collect the blog and return it to the user. When the user enters data into the input area, this data will need to be returned to the server and stored where it can be retrieved when the user returns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's break it down further:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We are not sure what the browser is going to send back to use, so first, let's upgrade our server to print the browser's requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once we know what we are getting from the browser, we can set up a program to handel that.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This is enough to get started. Let's look at how we are going to do TDD. First, we will need a testing framework. Standalone Jasmine will not work because it works only in the browser (i.e., in a web page). We will need to download Jasmine-node to test it. Then we will need to set up our directory with a spec directory containing a file that ends in "spec.js" because that is what Jasmine-node looks for by default. 
  </p>
  <h2>Setting up Jasmine to run Node.js</h2>
  <p>
    The first thing to do is download jasmine. This time you can do it globally because it will be accessing jasmine from the command line rather than from a web page. 
  </p>
</div>
<ol class="activity">
  <li class="enter">
     <code>sudo npm install -g jasmine</code>
  </li>
  <li class="enter">
     <code>mkdir ~/src/new-server</code>
  </li>
  <li class="enter">
     <code>cd ~/src/new-server</code>
  </li>
  <li class="enter">
     <code>jasmine init</code>
  </li>
  <li class="see">
    You should have a new directory in <code>new-server</code> called <code>spec</code>. There should be a directory in <code>spec</code> called <code>support</code> containing a single file called <code>jasmine.json</code>  
  </li>
</ol>
<div class="wp-text-area">
  <h2>Test 1: Making sure everything is in the right place</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we have the directories and files set up to run Jasmine using node.js, we can start building the code.
  </p>
  <h2>Creating the first test</h2>
  <p>
    We will create the new server in <code>~/src/new-server</code>. We will build the server there. The first thing we do is build a test. To make sure that we have everything in place, lets start just with a simple test that we hope will pass.

    This doesn't test much, but at least we know that the test system is working.
  </p>
  <h2>Test 2: First failing test</h2>
  <p>
    The first thing we do in Test Driven Development is write a failing test. This makes sure that the testing system can distinguish between a failing test and a successful test. We write a failing test so that we know that the code we wrote make the test succeed, as expected. If we wrote the code first and then the test, the test might succeed by accident, say because the test is flawed and really testing nothing, rather than from the code we just wrote. So, by writing a failing test first, we demonstrate that the test is really testing the code as we expect. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As a first test, let's check to see that the root directory is "html". To do this, we only need test that the variable <code>ROOT_DIR</code> equals <code>html/</code>.

    Success! The test has failed. We now know that our testing framework can succeed and fail, which is what you want a testing framework to do.
  </p>
  <h3>Making the test succeed.</h3>
  <p>
    Now that we have a failing test, we can write the code to make it succeed. The code should be small, and in this case it is. We write a file that defines <code>ROOT_DIR</code> and sets it to <code>html/</code>. The code is below. We will also need to update our test to include the code we are testing. We can do this by adding the lines in red. Jasmine is not really intended to do testing at this level of detail. It tests modules that have well defined interfaces. To actually load the code we are testing we need to read a file and then evaluate the file inside the test file. This is unfortunate, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

    Hurray! It worked. The testing framework found out code and that code made the failing test succeed.
  </p>
  <h3>Refactor the code</h3>
  <p>
    Next we refactor the code. Is there anything we can do to make this code clearer? Well ... not really. It's not doing much yet, so there's not much we can do. Time to celebrate by checking the code in to git..
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's push on.
  </p>
  <h2>Test 3: Defining the server function</h2>
  <p>
    Since there is nothing to refactor, we can go ahead and add a failing test. Let's build our server function. We can test that the function is defined. It does not need to do anything yet. We add the following test to <code>server-spec.js</code>. Run it and see it fail.

  <h2>Test 4: Reading from a file</h2>
  <p>
    Let's try to do some real work. We know that the server is going to need to read from a file to get the information to send back to the client, so let's try that part first with the following test.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="code">
  it("reads from a file", function() {
    expect(getPage('testFile.html')).toEqual('test');
  });
</div>
<div class="wp-text-area">
  <p>
    We run the code with <code>jasmine</code> and if fails.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="code">
</div>
<div class="wp-text-area">
  <p>
    Next we write the smallest piece of code that will satisfy the test. The following will do:
  </p>
</div>
<div class="code">
function getPage(pageName) {
  return('test');
}</div>
<div class="wp-text-area">
  <p>
    But this does not actually get a page, the intention of the function and this is the intention of TDD. At each stage we write the smallest piece of code that will do what we need. In this way, we can be sure that the tests are actually testing what the functionality that we need. When we are writing the tests, we are setting hurdles for ourselves. When we are writing the code we are trying to overcome those hurdles as quickly as possible. By "cheating" like this, we work to make sure that the tests actually test what we care about, not something that implies what we care about. Here, though the function returns what we expect, it does not actually read the file. We know that because we are writing the file and can correct it. All too often when we write code we write functions that pass the tests we think of, but do not pass the tests we do not think of. By shifting our focus back and forth between writing tests that will really ensure the code does what we want, and code that does what the test expects, we test that the code does not let detail slide.
  </p>
  <p>
    We run the code using <code>jasmine</code> and, as expected, it passes.

  <h2>Test 4.1: Reading from a file</h2>
  <p>
    Now we need to think. How can we be sure that the file is actually finding and reading from a file. One way to do that is to have the test function read the file and put the value that it read in to the test. This would ensure that the function under is actually reading from the file. This really does not add much effort for us, since we need to write the code to get the information from the file anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
    We try the following test:
  </p>
</div>
<div class="code">
  function getFileContents(fileName) {
    fs.readFile(ROOT_DIR + fileName, function(error, page) {
      if (error) {
        throw error;
      } else {
        return page;
        }
      });
  }

  it("reads from a file", function() {
    var fileContents = getFileContents('testfile.html');
    expect(getPage('testFile.html')).toEqual(fileContents);
  });
</div>
<div class="wp-text-area">
  <p>
    We run the code with <code>jasmine</code> and it fails. And it fails in an unexpected way. It says that it "Expected 'test' to equal undefined". We know that the getPage function is returning "test," so our file read function must be returning undefined.
